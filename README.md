# Spotify-Playlist-Recommendation-System
This project utilizes the Spotify API to recommend songs based on a user's playlist. It involves authenticating with the API, managing paginated data retrieval, and generating song recommendations. Through this project, I gained experience in API authentication, handling large datasets with pagination, and applying recommendation algorithms to provide personalized music suggestions.
